HOW IT WORKS?
first of all we need to install "SUSPECT app" in suspect's mobile on first launching of suspect app it ask for its "name" 
and "id" of the suspect and ask permission for location services.
* To start suspect app in service press connect button in suspect's phone.
* Remove the app from RAM.
* Then we will be able to track suspect location from sherlock's phone through "HAWK_EYE" app installed in another phone.
